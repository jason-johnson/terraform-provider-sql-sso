# sqlsso Provider

The SQL SSO provider provides resources for enabling SSO on the supported databases.  This can generally not be done by
the existing terraform resources because they work with e.g. ARM while enabling a user for SSO typically must be done from
within the database.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "sqlsso" {}
```
